		<h2>Site Planning Analysis Page</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Website Goal</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The goal of my website is to show off what I love to do most... cook!</li> 
				<li>Readers who visit my website should feel empowered to get into their kitchen and get their hands dirty (after they wash them of course!).</li>
				<li>I think that too often, home cooks can be scared to try something new, but learning to cook things that you aren't comfortable with is what makes you better.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Working Titles of Pages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Home</li>
				<li>Blog</li>
				<li>Recipe Page(s) - 2 or 3 recipes, one per page</li>
				<li>Challenge Recipes - This page will have a form that viewers can submit their own recipes to for me to attempt to recreate, because learning new things makes you better in the kitchen!</li>
				<li>About</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Information Requirements</h3>
			<p>Most of the text information, I already have.  They're my recipes after all.  My pictures will likely be in-process and finished pictures of each recipe, which will all be original.</p>
			<p>I don't expect to include many sounds or videos to start out with.  I don't think those two types of content will add anything meaningful to the site when it's first starting out.</p>
		<h3>Challenge Recipes</h3>
			<p>I think allowing visitors to submit their own recipes for me to try will add a sense of engagement to the website.  It'll also show that you can cook anything you put your mind to, you just have to try!</p>
			<p>The form would need to include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A space for an ingredient list (with measurements).</li>
				<li>A place to put recipe instructions, which should include timing.</li>
				<li>User's contact information.</li>
				<li>Any additional recipe notes or hints.</li>
			</ul>
