		<h1>About the Chef</h1>
		<p>Calling a person who has never had a cooking job, let alone a head chef job, a chef is a bit of a misnomer.  In most circles,<br>
		I would merely consider myself a home cook, and a very amateur one at that. I grew up in Harford County, Maryland, which<br>
		as anyone could tell you is technically part of the southern states.  It does after all sit below the mason-dixon line,<br> 
		which historically divided the northern and southern states.  However, if you've lived in that area, you probably consider<br>
		yourself part of the northern states, and you'd mostly be right. I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina in 2012, and everyone<br>
		considers North Carolina a southern state.  So here I am, a "Yankee" living in the "South." The cooking I do typically is<br>
		inspired by my childhood, in which my father was always the chef in the house. Yankee Southern Cooking is a way for me to<br>
		show how where I was born inspires how I cook now.</p>
		<p>Some of the recipes I've written about are adapted from other well-known chefs.  If so, I give credit where it's due, and I'll<br> 
		post the original recipe alongside my own. Others are family recipes, or recipes that my father adapted to his own style, and<br>
		I've since adapted myself. I don't have any attributable sources for those other than my family, and so they're what I'll<br> 
		consider original recipes. Feel free to use them however you'd like.  Maybe you'll find a better way to do something.<br>
		If you do, let me know! Shoot me an <a href='mailto:ChefGarrett@YankeeSouthernCooking.com.'>e-mail!</a></p>
		<p>If you'd like to see how I do cooking one of your recipes, submit one on my Challenges page.  I'd love to try out my skills at<br>
		cooking something that I've never done before.  I'm a firm believer that you'll never learn to get better unless you step out of<br>
		your comfort zone!</p>
